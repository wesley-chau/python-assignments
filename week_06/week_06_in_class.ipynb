It is essentially a pattern that allows us to write more performant code and lets us scale the complexity of our projects if we use them right.

If you find yourself reusing a lot of code, it's probably time to start considering a strategy like Classes to organize and modulate your programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes open up the opportunity for inheritance. This lets us create subclasses that take attributes and methods from parent classes. We'll go over these in the next lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially,the Class construct is a way for us to create custom types with their own functionality. This helps programmers map information in code that isn't strictly related to numerical operations. Used properly, it can really help with the long term functionality of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of the examples of this lesson, it's common to see classes (and more) implemented in the form of libraries. These libraries contain functionality that we desire, but maybe don't want to code ourselves. You can find more about libraries <a href=\"https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-libraries/\">here</a>."
